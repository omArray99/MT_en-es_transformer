### MT_en-es_transformer
Transformer-based Neural Machine Translation for English to Spanish using PyTorch

This repository hosts a neural machine translation (NMT) system designed to translate from English to Spanish. It utilizes a Transformer architecture, built and trained using PyTorch. The project includes customizable configuration for training details such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. The implementation covers all necessary components: model definition, dataset preparation, training, and validation routines. Users can train the model with provided settings or adjust configurations to cater to different scales of data or computational resources
